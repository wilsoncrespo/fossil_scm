# This is the top-level makefile for Fossil when the build is occurring
# on a unix platform.  This works out-of-the-box on most unix platforms.
# But you are free to vary some of the definitions if desired.
#
#### The toplevel directory of the source tree.  Fossil can be built
#    in a directory that is separate from the source tree.  Just change
#    the following to point from the build directory to the src/ folder.
#
SRCDIR = @srcdir@/src

#### The directory into which object code files should be written.
#    Having a "./" prefix in the value of this variable breaks our use of the
#    "makeheaders" tool when running make on the MinGW platform, apparently
#    due to some command line argument manipulation performed automatically
#    by the shell.
#

OBJDIR = bld

#### C Compiler and options for use in building executables that
#    will run on the platform that is doing the build.  This is used
#    to compile code-generator programs as part of the build process.
#    See TCC below for the C compiler for building the finished binary.
#
BCC = @CC_FOR_BUILD@

#### The suffix to add to final executable file.  When cross-compiling
#    to windows, make this ".exe".  Otherwise leave it blank.
#

TCC = @CC@

#### Tcl shell for use in running the fossil testsuite.  If you do not
#    care about testing the end result, this can be blank.

# Automatically reconfigure whenever an autosetup file or one of the
# make source files change.
#
# The "touch" is necessary to avoid a make loop due to a new upstream
# feature in autosetup (GH 0a71e3c3b7) which rewrites *.in outputs only
# if doing so will write different contents; otherwise, it leaves them
# alone so the mtime doesn't change.  This means that if you change one
# our depdendencies besides Makefile.in, we'll reconfigure but Makefile
# won't change, so this rule will remain out of date, so we'll reconfig
# but Makefile won't change, so we'll reconfig but... endlessly.
#
# This is also why we repeat the reconfig target's command here instead
# of delegating to it with "$(MAKE) reconfig": having children running
# around interfering makes this failure mode even worse.
