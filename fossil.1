.SH FEATURES

Features as described on the fossil home page.

.HP
1.
.B Integrated Bug Tracking, Wiki, Forum, and Technotes
- In addition to doing distributed version control like Git and
Mercurial, Fossil also supports bug tracking, wiki, forum, and
technotes.

.HP
2.
.B Built-in Web Interface
- Fossil has a built-in and intuitive web interface that promotes
project situational awareness. Type "fossil ui" and Fossil automatically
opens a web browser to a page that shows detailed graphical history and
status information on that project.

.HP
3.
.B Self-Contained
- Fossil is a single self-contained stand-alone executable. To install,
simply download a precompiled binary for Linux, Mac, OpenBSD, or Windows
and put it on your $PATH. Easy-to-compile source code is available for
users on other platforms.

.HP
4.
.B Simple Networking
- No custom protocols or TCP ports. Fossil uses plain old HTTP (or HTTPS
or SSH) for all network communications, so it works fine from behind
restrictive firewalls, including proxies. The protocol is bandwidth
efficient to the point that Fossil can be used comfortably over dial-up
or over the exceedingly slow Wifi on airliners.

.HP
5.
.B CGI/SCGI Enabled
- No server is required, but if you want to set one up, Fossil supports
four easy server configurations.

.HP
6.
.B Autosync
- Fossil supports "autosync" mode which helps to keep projects moving
forward by reducing the amount of needless forking and merging often
associated with distributed projects.

.HP
7.
.B Robust & Reliable
- Fossil stores content using an enduring file format in an SQLite
database so that transactions are atomic even if interrupted by a
power loss or system crash. Automatic self-checks verify that all
aspects of the repository are consistent prior to each commit.

.HP
8.
.B Free and Open-Source
- Uses the 2-clause BSD license.
