*******************************************************************************
**
** This file contains code used to manage a background processes that
** occur after user interaction with the repository.  Examples of
** backoffice processing includes:
**
**    *  Sending alerts and notifications
**    *  Processing the email queue
**    *  Automatically syncing to peer repositories
**
** Backoffice processing is automatically started whenever there are
** changes to the repository.  The backoffice process dies off after
** a period of inactivity.
**
** Steps are taken to ensure that only a single backoffice process is
** running at a time.  Otherwise, there could be race conditions that
** cause adverse effects such as multiple alerts for the same changes.
**
** At the same time, we do not want a backoffice process to run forever.
** Backoffice processes should die off after doing whatever work they need
** to do.  In this way, we avoid having lots of idle processes in the
** process table, doing nothing on rarely accessed repositories, and
** if the Fossil binary is updated on a system, the backoffice processes
** will restart using the new binary automatically.
**
** At any point in time there should be at most two backoffice processes.
** There is a main process that is doing the actually work, and there is
** a second stand-by process that is waiting for the main process to finish
** and that will become the main process after a delay.
**
** After any successful web page reply, the backoffice_check_if_needed()
** routine is called.  That routine checks to see if both one or both of
** the backoffice processes are already running.  That routine remembers the
** status in a global variable.
**
** Later, after the repository database is closed, the
** backoffice_run_if_needed() routine is called.  If the prior call
** to backoffice_check_if_needed() indicated that backoffice processing
** might be required, the run_if_needed() attempts to kick off a backoffice
** process.
**
** All work performance by the backoffice is in the backoffice_work()
** routine.
