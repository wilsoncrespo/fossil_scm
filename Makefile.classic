#### C Compiler and options for use in building executables that
#    will run on the platform that is doing the build.  This is used
#    to compile code-generator programs as part of the build process.
#    See TCC below for the C compiler for building the finished binary.

#### The suffix to add to final executable file.  When cross-compiling
#    to windows, make this ".exe".  Otherwise leave it blank.

#### C Compile and options for use in building executables that
#    will run on the target platform.  This is usually the same
